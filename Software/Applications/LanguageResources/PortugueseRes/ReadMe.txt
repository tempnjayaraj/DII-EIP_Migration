       MICROSOFT FOUNDATION CLASS LIBRARY for Windows CE: PortugueseRes
========================================================================


AppWizard has created this PortugueseRes DLL for you.  This DLL not only
demonstrates the basics of using the Microsoft Foundation classes but
is also a starting point for writing your DLL.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your PortugueseRes DLL.

PortugueseRes.h
	This is the main header file for the DLL.  It declares the
	CPortugueseResApp class.

PortugueseRes.cpp
	This is the main DLL source file.  It contains the class CPortugueseResApp.


PortugueseRes.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows CE resources that the
    program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored
    in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft
	eMbedded Visual C++.

PortugueseRes.def
    This file contains information about the DLL that must be
    provided to run with Microsoft Windows CE.  It defines parameters
    such as the name and description of the DLL.  It also exports
	functions from the DLL.

PortugueseRes.vcc
    This file contains information used by ClassWizard to edit existing
    classes or add new classes.  ClassWizard also uses this file to store
    information needed to create and edit message maps and dialog data
    maps and to create prototype member functions.
